# AlgoX
Created in Unity, Algo X was created to help new programmers visualize sorting algorithms in a smaller set. The use has the control to choose what instruction to do next, with alerts when a wrong instruction is executed for the algorithm. It provides a much more tactile experience then just a simple visualizer to better understand the underlying code.
